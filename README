The BinderFilter + Picky project is described in detail in the accompanying pdf writeup. For technical instructions on how everything compiles, continue reading.

This is a kernel firewall for Android. We implement it in two projects: BinderFilter is the kernel driver that implements blocking, modifying, context values, etc. Picky is the Android application that allows users to set firewall policy. Our BinderFilter kernel driver hooks Binder's kernel driver by adding our function hook into /drivers/staging/android/binder.c. This requires us to recompile the kernel and then "flash" the new image onto a phone.

We have tested and verified this method on a Google Nexus 7 (2013- flo). 
Note that Picky requires a lockscreen to work

The easiest "installation" of this project is as follows:

1. root your android phone
2. enable usb debugging
3. unlock bootloader
4. download fastboot and adb

5. connect your phone to the laptop with usb debugging enabled
6. in terminal, adb reboot bootloader
7. fastboot flash boot kernel-image.img
8. press start
9. phone will reboot, then install picky apk (adb install picky.apk)

kernel-image.img and picky.apk can be found at:
